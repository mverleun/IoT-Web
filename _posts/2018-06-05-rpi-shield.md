Today I added a [Raspberry Pi](/docs/raspberry-pi/) to the components. It's great device to be the heart of any IoT solution. It can serve as a MQTT broker in combination with the firmwares described that run on a Wemos D1.

We've build prototypes in the past, tested them and are ready for production.
Unfortunate we lack the funds to start mass producing them and mass production is required to keep the price low.

The following picture gives shows the shield, which fits a Raspberry Pi Zero as well as a regular Raspberry Pi.
