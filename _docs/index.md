It's entirely up to you which parts of the IoT kit you use in your lessons.
One component however is mandatory and that is a MQTT server. WiFi with WPA2 protection is recommended. Do not use WPA2 Enterprise authentication as most devices don't support it.

To start easy I recommend that you also use [Node RED](https://nodered.org). Node RED runs on many different platforms and is for 'Flow-based programming for the Internet of Things' as they state on their website.

Raspbian, the default OS for the Raspberry Pi, comes with Node RED preinstalled.
