I've been working on the IoT Kit for Education, or Iot kit for short, for some time now.

It deserves a proper description on how to use all the components so it was about time that I created this website.
Over time I'll provide more information on how the Iot Kit can be used.
A lot of information can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mverleun/IoT-devices).
