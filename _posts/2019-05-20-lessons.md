After quite some time I've found the time to work on the IoT Kit website.

This time I started with the first lessons that you can use in your own class. At the moment I've written the first four lessons:

- [Lesson 1: Prepare Raspberry Pi](https://www.iot-kit.nl/docs/lesson-1/)
- [Lesson 2: Check hardware](https://www.iot-kit.nl/docs/lesson-2/)
- [Lesson 3: Connect to MQTT broker](https://www.iot-kit.nl/docs/lesson-3/)
- [Lesson 4: More Node RED](https://www.iot-kit.nl/docs/lesson-4/)
