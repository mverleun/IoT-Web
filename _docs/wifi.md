MQTT is a lightweight protocol. As such you won't need much bandwith. At the time of this writing many popular microcontrollers, including the famous ESP8266 based ones, support the 802.1n standard. Don't expect a high throughput, the device itself is limited so any reasonable 802.1n accesspoint will keep up with it.
