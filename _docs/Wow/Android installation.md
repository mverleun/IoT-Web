title: Install Owntracks on Android

I do not have an Android device, as a result I can't make screenshots :-(

The features of Android are described [here](https://owntracks.org/booklet/features/android/)

You can download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android)

Make sure that you download the App from Alexander Rust
